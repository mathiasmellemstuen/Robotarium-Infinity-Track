# Robotarium Infinity Track

You should design, simulate and run a simple robotic experiment on the Robotarium platform at: https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/ The essence  of  this  task  is  motion  planning  and  control.   You  should  have  a  simple  robot  movearound in a pattern that resembles the shape of the infinity symbol∞, as shown in the figure above.The exact shape of your course need not be the same as shown in this figure.  It is enough that itlooks like the infinity symbol.Make sure that the intersection point of your course is at the origin (0,0) , and make sure that therobot never moves away from the origin by more than 2 metres.This assignment must be done individually. You are allowed to freely discuss with anyone. Youare allowed to design the motion planning and control algorithms in collaboration with others. But youmust write your own code, your own simulations and your own submission to the Robotarium platform.
### 2.  Submitting your work
You must submit two files on the Canvas page:(1)  One PDF file which is the report of your effort and result.  This PDF file can be no more thantwo pages long, and should be structured along the lines suggested in the next section.(2)  One video file in the MP4 format showing the movement produced by your Motion planningand Control algorithm.  The video must have a duration of less than 2 minutes !Note that only files in the PDF format and mp4 format shall be accepted.Deadline for submissionis 14:00 on Wednesday the 23rd of September
## 3.  Structure of report
Your reports should not be more than 2 pages long.  Please structure your report into separate partsthat:
- State the task undertaken
- State your motion planning algorithm•Summarize results of simulation (and possible redesign)
- Summarize results of experiment at Robotarium
## Installation on Ubuntu and other Debian based distributions
- git clone https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium_python_simulator.git
- pip3 install .

Try sudo apt-get install pip3 or sudo apt-get install git if it failes. Use pip instead of pip3 if you are using Python 2.x interpreter instead of Python 3.x
